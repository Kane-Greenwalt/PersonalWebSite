      <h2>Welcome To my site!</h2>
      <p>In this website you will be able to see more about me. Wether you're a potential employer or just curious to learn more about me, there is something for you on this site. This site was all
      hard coded using the IDE Atom. Feel free to check out my resume and refer to the contact page if you would like to talk more. Thank you for visiting!</p>
      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>More things to know about me is that I am a very outgoing person. I can and will talk to just about anybody. I love to socialize with people and make new friends. Other things to know is that
      I love to program. I know a couple different languages such as C#, C++, html, and some Java. Such as this website, this website was coded entirely by hand (with the exception of a few StackOverflow visits).
      Other things I like to do is film making. Creating YouTube videos and short films.
      <br>
      <strong>Future Goals:</strong> My goal is to own my own media studio. I would love to work with companies on creating a media presence by creating videos and nice photography. Currently I do some freelance
      media work for different companies. Doing that work is so much fun. Another goal I have is to be living in my own apartment by the beginning of June 2020.
